Thatcham Town Council’s flagship event, Thatcham Family Fun Day, returns to Henwick Worthy Sports Field for the 25th year and is set to be bigger and better than ever! Over 10,000 people joined us in 2024, and with lots of old favourites returning, including the classic funfair, and lots of new stalls, food and entertainment to discover, the Family Fun Day will continue to be what many consider to be Thatcham’s best free entry day out of the year!
