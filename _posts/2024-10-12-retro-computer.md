This year on the 12th October we will once again be holding our popular Retro Computing event as part of the Thatcham Town Council Art Festival. Pop along to the Pavilion located next to the Workshop and get to have a go on the many computers and games consoles we will have on display. Test your driving skills on our droid track, or do battle in a Battle Bots arena.
