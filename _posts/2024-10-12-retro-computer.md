We held our annual Retro Computer event on the 12th October. Despite the weather, turnout exceeded last years numbers. Our members provided an excellant range of computers most of which were working. We also had a room of Games Consoles including some handheld devices. The Hackspace Droid driving course was also availble for the vistors to try. For those who prefer phyical gaming we had a Battle bots arena.
