We held our annual Retro Computer event on the 12th October. Despite the weather, turnout exceeded last year's numbers. Our members provided an excellent range of computers most of which were working. We also had a room of Games Consoles including some handheld devices. The Hackspace Droid driving course was also available for the visitors to try. For those who prefer phyiscal gaming we had a Battle bots arena.
